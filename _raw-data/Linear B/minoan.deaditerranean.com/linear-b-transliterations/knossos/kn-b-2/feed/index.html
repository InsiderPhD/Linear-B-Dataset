		<description><![CDATA[Hello. I am currently studying the Linear B Tablets. My teacher is Richard Vallance whom I see you already are in touch with. Can you tell me where I can get pictures of the RA Series tablets dealing with Military Affairs at Knossos. I already have some which Richard has sent me to work on. These I have deciphered  but need more of the Military tablets especially so as to carry on with my study while Richard my teacher is away.  The ones I already have are....1540  1542  1543  1544  1545   1548  1550  1551     1552     553  1554   1555   1556    I would be most grateful for your help.
