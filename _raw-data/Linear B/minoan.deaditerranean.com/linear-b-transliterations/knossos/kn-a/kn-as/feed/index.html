		<description><![CDATA[Dear Dr. Turecek,

What follows is my brief analysis of your interpretation as given above (an indepth investigation would require much more time and include precise references to published materials, of course, which I do not have time for at the moment).

&lt;b&gt;OPISIJO&lt;/b&gt;

First of all, let us focus on /opis&lt;b&gt;IJO&lt;/b&gt;/. We can have a look at the various forms attested in modern and old Slavic languages (the 3pl forms):

Ukr. описують /opys&lt;b&gt;uyutʹ&lt;/b&gt;/
Bel. апісваюць /apis&lt;b&gt;vajuć&lt;/b&gt;/
Rus. описывают /opis&lt;b&gt;yvayut&lt;/b&gt;/
Bul. описват /opis&lt;b&gt;vat&lt;/b&gt;/
Mak. опишуваат /opiš&lt;b&gt;uvaat&lt;/b&gt;/
SC. /opis&lt;b&gt;uju&lt;/b&gt;/
Sln. /opis&lt;b&gt;ujejo&lt;/b&gt;/
Slk. /popis&lt;b&gt;ujú&lt;/b&gt;/
LMCz. /popis&lt;b&gt;ují&lt;/b&gt;/, SMCz /popis&lt;b&gt;ujou&lt;/b&gt;/
OCz. /popis&lt;b&gt;ujú&lt;/b&gt;/

The traditional Proto-Slavic reconstruction would be *opis&lt;b&gt;ati&lt;/b&gt; and *opis&lt;b&gt;ovati&lt;/b&gt;, with 3pl forms *opisǫtъ (giving Czech opíš&lt;b&gt;ou&lt;/b&gt; due to the completely &lt;b&gt;regular&lt;/b&gt; change of the nasal ending to &lt;b&gt;-ou&lt;/b&gt; via intermediary *-ou- and loss of the final dental; future reference) and *opisujǫtъ (giving Czech opis&lt;b&gt;ujú&lt;/b&gt; through a similar set of regular changes; present reference).

So, if I were supposed to consider this &lt;b&gt;opisijo&lt;/b&gt; a Slavic formation, I would have to note three problems:
1. it appears to share some features with Czecho-Slovak and Sloveno-Serbo-Croat, and is different from Lekhitic, Eastern Slavonic and Bulgaro-Macedonian, being thus &lt;b&gt;innovative&lt;/b&gt; in this respect rather than archaic;
2. -&lt;b&gt;ijo&lt;/b&gt; rather than the expected -&lt;b&gt;ujo&lt;/b&gt; could be due to an &lt;b&gt;irregular&lt;/b&gt; regressive assimilation, which is not impossible, but would point to its being &lt;b&gt;innovative&lt;/b&gt; rather than archaic;
3. a question arises here how a Slavonic language supposedly spoken more than three millenia ago could show such innovative traits, which speak completely against its archaic character?

&lt;b&gt;DUVA&lt;/b&gt;

While it is absolutely correct that in some SCr. dialects intervocallic /x/ changes to /v/ due to lenition/elision, it is important to note that it is a &lt;b&gt;late change&lt;/b&gt;, quite common cross-linguistically, whereby a fricative is first voiced between vowels and only the labial feature (due to the neighbouring /u/) is preserved. Hence, a development such as this can be imagined: /duxa/ &#062; /duɣa/ &#062; /duva/. Most dialects preserve the original /x/, however, which can hardly be ignored. A change in the opposite direction (/v/ &#062; /x/) is unlikely and almost unattested, as far as I know (although Armenian shows it is not entirely impossible).
Nevertheless, as we know well that this /x/ comes from an earlier sibilant in Slavic (proven, for example, by the related word /duša/), we can be absolutely sure it &lt;b&gt;is impossible&lt;/b&gt; in this particular word. Hence, /duva/ meaning /duxa/ (Czech ducha) can and must be ruled out.

&lt;b&gt;TIJO&lt;/b&gt;
No Slavic language points to this form. All Slavic languages point to Proto-Slavic N. sg. *tě&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o, Gen. sg. *tě&lt;b&gt;lese&lt;/b&gt;:

Cz. tě&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o, tě&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;a (older tě&lt;b&gt;lese&lt;/b&gt;)
Slk. tě&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o, tě&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;a
Sln. tě&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o, tě&lt;b&gt;lesa&lt;/b&gt;
Ch. tije&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o, tije&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;a
Ser., Rus. te&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o, te&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;a
Bul. tya&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o
Mak. te&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o
Bel. cie&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;a
Ukr. ti&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o, ti&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;a
Pol. cia&lt;b&gt;ł&lt;/b&gt;o, cia&lt;b&gt;ł&lt;/b&gt;a
Old Church Slavonic tě&lt;b&gt;l&lt;/b&gt;o, tě&lt;b&gt;lese&lt;/b&gt;

It is true that SCr. dialects have -&lt;b&gt;ije&lt;/b&gt;-, but it only exists in the &lt;b&gt;ije&lt;/b&gt;kavian dialects, in which Proto-Slavic long *&lt;b&gt;ě&lt;/b&gt; has changed to &lt;b&gt;ije&lt;/b&gt;. The word you translate as &quot;body&quot; shows a dialectal (and &lt;b&gt;late&lt;/b&gt;) development and and unexplained &lt;b&gt;loss&lt;/b&gt; of an integral part of the root. In your system, one would expect the Linear B form to be TERO, but it is TIJO. Why? The vowel &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt; is another problem. How do you explain it?

&lt;b&gt;DUTO&lt;/b&gt;

This word is, perhaps, less problematic. I think, nevertheless, you may have misunderstood a little the entry in the Polish dictionary you have referred to. The PSl. adjectival stem /d&lt;b&gt;ǫ&lt;/b&gt;t-/ has a nasal vowel, as you can see, which is witnessed by Polish, for instance. It is of deverbal (participial) origin (cf. the Czech verb /douti/ &#060; PSl. */d&lt;b&gt;ǫ&lt;/b&gt;ti/ &quot;to blow&quot;), whence its original meaning &quot;blown&quot;, &quot;inflated&quot;. The meaning &quot;hollow&quot; is, thus, a secondary semantic development. As for the meaning &quot;proud&quot;, it is nowhere attested as merely */d&lt;b&gt;ǫ&lt;/b&gt;t-/. As far as I can remember, it always requires the perfectivizing prefix /na-/ (cf. the Czech and Polish forms). There is no reason to suppose the meaning should be &quot;proud&quot; here.
Formally, the &lt;b&gt;-o&lt;/b&gt; ending seems to agree with what Slavicists reconstruct. You may know there are two sets of adjectives in Slavic: short and long. The short ones have &lt;b&gt;-ъ&lt;/b&gt; for the masculine, &lt;b&gt;-a&lt;/b&gt; for the feminine and &lt;b&gt;-o&lt;/b&gt; for the neuter gender forms.
The long (or definite) forms require another suffix coming from the indefinite anaphoric 3rd-person pronoun, hence we would have */dǫt&lt;b&gt;ъjь&lt;/b&gt;/ (masc.), */dǫt&lt;b&gt;oje&lt;/b&gt;/ (neutr.) and */dǫt&lt;b&gt;aja&lt;/b&gt;/ (fem.), continuing completely regularly in Modern Czech /dutý/, /duté/ and /dutá/.
The final /-o/ would fit nicely with the indefinite neuter form then.
The only problems that remain are 1) WHY in a form that is supposed to be archaic we have a formal feature (&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt; instead of &lt;b&gt;ǫ&lt;/b&gt;) that is &lt;b&gt;known&lt;/b&gt; to be later, and 2) HOW can we consider the meaning of the word to be &quot;proud&quot; while we also know this to be a secondary, or even tertiary, development?

The Proto-Slavic forms as reconstructed by Slavicists would be (if we preserve the word order as assumed by you):

*opisujǫtъ *duxa a *tělo *dǫto

Let us compare the Linear B transliteration of this to what we should expect to see in the text (of course, taking your system into account):

OPISUJO(&#124;)TU DUKA A TERO DO(&#124;)TO
OPISIJO DUVA A TIJO DUTO

There are undisputable differences you need to explain.

Now that I have shown a lot of &lt;b&gt;good will&lt;/b&gt;, having taken time to look at your version of the text, let me check your transliteration against a picture of the tablet (e.g. &lt;a href=&#039;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_6Uo8vCsOS8k/SuRPz2j-XaI/AAAAAAAAAAk/R65ubjF8QxI/s1600/1.jpg&#039; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; ). I can see a few more problems, I am afraid:

1. OPISIJO is followed by an ideogram of &quot;man&quot; (VIR in the transliteration system Kim uses). You totally neglect its presence. How do you interpret it?
2. The syllabogram you transliterate as DU is, indeed, similar to DU, yet still different enough. If you look at its upper part carefully, you will see the difference. This is a symbol usually transcribed as &lt;b&gt;A3&lt;/b&gt;.
3. The third character of the second word is damaged, but from what remains it is not inconceivable to interpret it as TO. It is actually the only option I deem likely considering the shape. You have chosen to ignore this symbol too. Why?
4. The next symbol is another &quot;man&quot; ideogram, ignored by you again. Why?
5. Then we have the vertical stroke, denoting number &quot;1&quot;. You neglect it. Why? Why, do you think, are there any numbers within the text?
6. The next symbol is yet another &quot;man&quot; ideogram, ignored by you as usual. Why?
7. The same problem as in 5.
8. The next symbol is the DU syllabogram (you do see the difference, do you not?).
9. Then we have TO, which is fine, but then there is another &quot;man&quot; ideogram followed by &quot;1&quot;.

Hence, what we can really see is the following:

OPISIJO &quot;man&quot; (&quot;1&quot;?) A3-WA-(TO) &quot;man&quot; &quot;1&quot; ATIJO &quot;man&quot; &quot;1&quot; DUTO &quot;man&quot; &quot;1&quot;

Even if we interpret A3 as DU, there is another symbol following WA you have to explain.
Comparing all three versions we can see the differences clearly:
&lt;b&gt;Attested&lt;/b&gt;: OPISIJO &quot;man&quot; (&quot;1&quot;?) A3-WA-(TO) &quot;man&quot; &quot;1&quot; ATIJO &quot;man&quot; &quot;1&quot; DUTO &quot;man&quot; &quot;1&quot;
&lt;b&gt;Expected if Slavic&lt;/b&gt;: OPISUJO(&#124;)TU DUKA A TERO DO(&#124;)TO
&lt;b&gt;Yours&lt;/b&gt;: OPISIJO DUVA A TIJO DUTO

So, I think I have shown some of the main problems. Of course, one must not forget about the arbitrary word delimitation that only increases ambiguity.

I am aware of the fact that some of the concepts I have used in my response can be quite opaque, especially to someone not acquainted with linguistic principles and terminology. Should you have any problems with that, please, let me know, I will try to ellucidate matters as much as possible.

Best regards,

Bul. описват /opis<b>vat</b>/<br />
Mak. опишуваат /opiš<b>uvaat</b>/<br />
SC. /opis<b>uju</b>/<br />
Sln. /opis<b>ujejo</b>/<br />
Slk. /popis<b>ujú</b>/<br />
LMCz. /popis<b>ují</b>/, SMCz /popis<b>ujou</b>/<br />
OCz. /popis<b>ujú</b>/</p>
<p>The traditional Proto-Slavic reconstruction would be *opis<b>ati</b> and *opis<b>ovati</b>, with 3pl forms *opisǫtъ (giving Czech opíš<b>ou</b> due to the completely <b>regular</b> change of the nasal ending to <b>-ou</b> via intermediary *-ou- and loss of the final dental; future reference) and *opisujǫtъ (giving Czech opis<b>ujú</b> through a similar set of regular changes; present reference).</p>

2. &#8211;<b>ijo</b> rather than the expected &#8211;<b>ujo</b> could be due to an <b>irregular</b> regressive assimilation, which is not impossible, but would point to its being <b>innovative</b> rather than archaic;<br />
3. a question arises here how a Slavonic language supposedly spoken more than three millenia ago could show such innovative traits, which speak completely against its archaic character?</p>
<p><b>DUVA</b></p>
<p>While it is absolutely correct that in some SCr. dialects intervocallic /x/ changes to /v/ due to lenition/elision, it is important to note that it is a <b>late change</b>, quite common cross-linguistically, whereby a fricative is first voiced between vowels and only the labial feature (due to the neighbouring /u/) is preserved.

<p><b>TIJO</b><br />
No Slavic language points to this form. All Slavic languages point to Proto-Slavic N. sg. *tě<b>l</b>o, Gen. sg. *tě<b>lese</b>:</p>
<p>Cz. tě<b>l</b>o, tě<b>l</b>a (older tě<b>lese</b>)<br />
Slk. tě<b>l</b>o, tě<b>l</b>a<br />

Ch. tije<b>l</b>o, tije<b>l</b>a<br />
Ser., Rus. te<b>l</b>o, te<b>l</b>a<br />
Bul. tya<b>l</b>o<br />
Mak. te<b>l</b>o<br />
Bel. cie<b>l</b>a<br />
Ukr. ti<b>l</b>o, ti<b>l</b>a<br />
Pol. cia<b>ł</b>o, cia<b>ł</b>a<br />
Old Church Slavonic tě<b>l</b>o, tě<b>lese</b></p>
<p>It is true that SCr. dialects have &#8211;<b>ije</b>-, but it only exists in the <b>ije</b>kavian dialects, in which Proto-Slavic long *<b>ě</b> has changed to <b>ije</b>. The word you translate as &#8220;body&#8221; shows a dialectal (and <b>late</b>) development and and unexplained <b>loss</b> of an integral part of the root. In your system, one would expect the Linear B form to be TERO, but it is TIJO. Why? The vowel <b>i</b> is another problem. How do you explain it?</p>
<p><b>DUTO</b></p>
<p>This word is, perhaps, less problematic. I think, nevertheless, you may have misunderstood a little the entry in the Polish dictionary you have referred to. The PSl. adjectival stem /d<b>ǫ</b>t-/ has a nasal vowel, as you can see, which is witnessed by Polish, for instance. It is of deverbal (participial) origin (cf. the Czech verb /douti/ &lt; PSl. */d<b>ǫ</b>ti/ &#8220;to blow&#8221;), whence its original meaning &#8220;blown&#8221;, &#8220;inflated&#8221;.

The long (or definite) forms require another suffix coming from the indefinite anaphoric 3rd-person pronoun, hence we would have */dǫt<b>ъjь</b>/ (masc.), */dǫt<b>oje</b>/ (neutr.) and */dǫt<b>aja</b>/ (fem.), continuing completely regularly in Modern Czech /dutý/, /duté/ and /dutá/.<br />
The final /-o/ would fit nicely with the indefinite neuter form then.<br />

2. The syllabogram you transliterate as DU is, indeed, similar to DU, yet still different enough. If you look at its upper part carefully, you will see the difference. This is a symbol usually transcribed as <b>A3</b>.<br />
3. The third character of the second word is damaged, but from what remains it is not inconceivable to interpret it as TO. It is actually the only option I deem likely considering the shape. You have chosen to ignore this symbol too. Why?<br />
4. The next symbol is another &#8220;man&#8221; ideogram, ignored by you again. Why?<br />
5. Then we have the vertical stroke, denoting number &#8220;1&#8221;. You neglect it. Why? Why, do you think, are there any numbers within the text?<br />
6. The next symbol is yet another &#8220;man&#8221; ideogram, ignored by you as usual. Why?<br />
7. The same problem as in 5.<br />
8. The next symbol is the DU syllabogram (you do see the difference, do you not?).<br />
9. Then we have TO, which is fine, but then there is another &#8220;man&#8221; ideogram followed by &#8220;1&#8221;.</p>
<p>Hence, what we can really see is the following:</p>
<p>OPISIJO &#8220;man&#8221; (&#8220;1&#8221;?) A3-WA-(TO) &#8220;man&#8221; &#8220;1&#8221; ATIJO &#8220;man&#8221; &#8220;1&#8221; DUTO &#8220;man&#8221; &#8220;1&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if we interpret A3 as DU, there is another symbol following WA you have to explain.<br />
Comparing all three versions we can see the differences clearly:<br />
<b>Attested</b>: OPISIJO &#8220;man&#8221; (&#8220;1&#8221;?) A3-WA-(TO) &#8220;man&#8221; &#8220;1&#8221; ATIJO &#8220;man&#8221; &#8220;1&#8221; DUTO &#8220;man&#8221; &#8220;1&#8221;<br />
<b>Expected if Slavic</b>: OPISUJO(|)TU DUKA A TERO DO(|)TO<br />
<b>Yours</b>: OPISIJO DUVA A TIJO DUTO</p>
<p>So, I think I have shown some of the main problems. Of course, one must not forget about the arbitrary word delimitation that only increases ambiguity.</p>
<p>I am aware of the fact that some of the concepts I have used in my response can be quite opaque, especially to someone not acquainted with linguistic principles and terminology. Should you have any problems with that, please, let me know, I will try to ellucidate matters as much as possible.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Sergey Kyrillyev</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Mr. Kiminoa, this is a reply to your 19 July 2012 at 16:28  comment: Statistics was, is and will ever be a part of mathematics. It has nothing in common with linguistics. And I am sorry, I will not discuss with you a definition of linguistics. Greek interpretation of linear scripts is a radical nonsense and I am not interested in reading this nonsense literature anymore. The brutal, unaducated and hunting Greek tribes accepted a lot of concepts and names of slavonic tribes settled at Balkan and so their language got the indo-slavonic feature. This is the reason Ventris could decipher several words. Also, Ventris´s decipherment of the sequence KO-NO-SO as the name of Knossos is a nonsense. When decipHering the 2nd line of KN As 1516 it is important to notice the words KO and KI meaning &quot;as so&quot;. So, the 2nd line is to be read like KO NOSIJAšč KI VAKEJAšč DA A NU VIKO.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[KN As 1516, row 14: 
OPISIJO DUVA A TIJO DUTO
OPISIJO = they describe

the describe spirit and body proudly

So, neither I did not know this word when associating the linear signs together, nor the polish scientists knew this word existed and was written on the tablet KN As 1516 when they were reconstruncting their Proto-Slawonic dictionary. This row is an unquestionable prove of the Slavonic origin of the linear writing.
