		<description><![CDATA[EREPATO in Mycenaean Greek. Is this the word for “ivory” or “slain in war”? Extensive Evidence for the case against the latter

Résumé:

Even a cursory examination of Gretchen Leonhardt’s translation of Knossos tablet KN V 684 reveals several discrepancies, a much too heavy reliance on the West Greek Doric dialect, which bears little resemblance to the East Greek dialects, Mycenaean Greek in Linear B and its slightly younger cousin, Arcado-Cypriot in Linear C. Her marked reliance on Doric Greek vocabulary effectively invalidates her translation of Knossos Tablet KN V 684.
       
Her inflexible insistence on translating the Linear B EREPATO as “slain in war” or “slain by Ares” rubs against the grain and runs totally counter to the accepted (and correct) translation,“ivory”. Pylos tablet PY Sy 794, of which the context is extremely precise, i.e. that of craftsmanship, clinches the matter. In this context, only one translation for EREPATO works, and that is “ivory”. Period. Certainly not “slain in war” or “slain by Ares”, unless the translator of the Pylos tablet consciously strives radically change the meaning of almost all the other words, to force them to conform with his or her pet decipherment of just one single word on the Pylos tablet. But this is patently a very risky, if not outright dangerous, route to pursue, since it is bound to warp huge chunks of Mycenaean vocabulary way out of joint, the more and more one relies on it and pursues it to the exclusion of most if not all other impinging factors, when translating any word(s) on any Linear B tablet whatsoever.

In our post refuting her fanciful translation, we posit eight(8)very sound reasons as extremely convincing circumstantial evidence that in fact Ms. Leonhardt’s translation strays far from the mark, here:

In light of our in-depth analysis of her putative translation, the end result is that it simply crumbles to pieces. Compare my crashingly boring inventory of IVORY of the very same tablet in this same post, and you will instantly see that my own version of the meaning of this tablet neatly conforms with historical and contemporary tried and tested translations of the same.
