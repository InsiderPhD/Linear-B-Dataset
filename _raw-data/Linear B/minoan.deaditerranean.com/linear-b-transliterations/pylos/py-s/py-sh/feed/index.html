		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a good argument here that they&#039;re contextually different.  pa-ra-jo is used here as an adjective describing ARM on PY Sh 740 and pa-ra-wa-jo is used as a noun that&#039;s being counted on PY Sh 737, parallel to ko-ru-to (helmet).

I&#039;ve added Chadwick &amp; Ventris&#039; 1973 theory for [[pa-ra-wa-jo]] for you.  It also appears on [[KN Sk]] for further context.

Once I get all of the lexicon on to the site (an on-going task that I will be at for quite awhile...), I&#039;ll be able to start updating with more current theories on some of these words, though in many cases, the 2008 or even 2011 versions of the theories echo Chadwick &amp; Ventris&#039; work.  I&#039;m hoping there&#039;s something new on me-zo and me-u-jo; I find their definition in this context a bit hard to believe.]]></description>
