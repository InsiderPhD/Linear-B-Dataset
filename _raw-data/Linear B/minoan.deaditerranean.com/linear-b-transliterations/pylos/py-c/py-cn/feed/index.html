		<description><![CDATA[Dear Dr. Tureček,

I am sorry for the terrible delay. I have been travelling these days. Nonetheless, I should be able to find some time to reply to your comments.
Let me start with this one, as the others require much more time to write and formulate. I hope to be able to write them tonight.

Once and again, unfortunately, I have to object to some of your assertions.
Ventris was well-acquainted with the principles of language as well as linguistic methodology. Matej Bor, however, was not. After all, Bor&#039;s claims were easily rebutted by Slovenian linguists right after the publication of the co-authored book.
You see, writing about language does not make you a linguist. Using linguistic methodology rigorously and consistently does.

Horák, I am afraid, whose monograph I have wasted some of my time on, knew little about linguistics and his conclusions are considered a good joke among all linguists and historians, not only of Slavic descent.

You seem to stress the importance of Ventris&#039;s Polish ancestry. Why, if I may ask you?

Best regards,

Sergey Kyrillyev]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. SCr. &lt;b&gt;terati&lt;/b&gt; is not intransitive and does NOT mean &quot;&lt;b&gt;to run&lt;/b&gt;&quot;. It is a &lt;b&gt;transitive&lt;/b&gt; verb meaning &quot;&lt;b&gt;to drive&lt;/b&gt;&quot; someone, to &quot;&lt;b&gt;push&lt;/b&gt;&quot; somebody, to &quot;&lt;b&gt;actuate&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;b&gt;chase&lt;/b&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;b&gt;compel&lt;/b&gt;&quot; them. Where is the object then? Is it a case of elision?
2. SCr. &lt;b&gt;terati&lt;/b&gt; belongs to a different conjugation class: its 1sg form should be &lt;b&gt;teram&lt;/b&gt;, with an &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; in the stem. It cannot be the same verb, unless, of course, you ignore distinctiveness of vowel quality in Slavic. Do you?
3. If I loosen my standards and agree for a while it &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; this verb, we have another problem: there is no indication at all the ending should be &lt;b&gt;-m. It could just as well be &lt;b&gt;-š&lt;/b&gt; (2sg indicative), &lt;b&gt;-j&lt;/b&gt; (2sg imperative) or even &lt;b&gt;-h&lt;/b&gt; (1sg aorist/imperfect). Most information concerning declension and conjugation would be lost in your system, which would lead to a lot of ambiguity.
4. As far as I know, your claim that &quot;DO associates always with 3rd case&quot; is patently incorrect. The preposition &quot;do&quot; always requires the following noun phrase to be in the &lt;b&gt;GENITIVE&lt;/b&gt;, or the &lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; case if you will. Your confusion is rather surprising to me, since this is true not only for SCr., but also for your native language (please, correct any mistakes - although I do understand written Czech rather well, I am far from fluent in it): &quot;&lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; les&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; ohn&lt;b&gt;ě&lt;/b&gt;&quot;,  or &quot;&lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; vod&lt;b&gt;y&lt;/b&gt;&quot; rather than &quot;do lesu&quot;, &quot;do ohni&quot; or &quot;do vodě&quot;.
5. I believe it is already obvious that &lt;b&gt;kanapeu&lt;/b&gt; cannot be dative, but there is another argument against this assumption of yours. There are basically two declension types among the SCr. neuter nouns that have an &lt;b&gt;-E&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;1st&lt;/b&gt;case (&lt;b&gt;nominative&lt;/b&gt;). The first type only changes this final &lt;b&gt;-E&lt;/b&gt; to &lt;b&gt;-U&lt;/b&gt;, thus &quot;polj&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;&quot; becomes &quot;polj&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;&quot;. The second type requires a stem consonant between the nominative part and the dative suffix (in fact, SCr. has lost this consonant in the nominative, accusative and vocative, while it has been preserved in the other cases), thus &quot;im&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;&quot; becomes &quot;ime&lt;b&gt;nu&lt;/b&gt;&quot;, &quot;tel&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;&quot; becomes &quot;tele&lt;b&gt;tu&lt;/b&gt;&quot; and &quot;več&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;&quot; becomes &quot;veče&lt;b&gt;ru&lt;/b&gt;&quot;. Your &quot;kanape&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;&quot; , if neuter as in Czech, should thus be &quot;kanap&lt;b&gt;u&lt;/b&gt;&quot; with no &lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt; before the case ending.
6. Another problem with this word that you translate as &quot;hemp&quot; is the SCr. name for this plant itself: &lt;b&gt;konoplja&lt;/b&gt;. As you see, it is a feminine noun whose dative ending is &lt;b&gt;-I&lt;/b&gt; and its dative form is thus &quot;konoplj&lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;&quot;. The genitive does not work either: &quot;konoplj&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;.
7. As your would-be evidence for the &quot;cannabis&quot; connection has just fallen apart, it is, I hope, absolutely clear the similarity between Czech &quot;konopiště&quot; and Greek &quot;Kanopos&quot; is merely accidental. Or is there any other evidence for the Greek proper name meaning &quot;hemp&quot; apart from the phonetic similarity?
8. The Slavic words for &quot;acre&quot; have been borrowed from Germanic languages rather recently. They are not attested in earlier records.
9. You suggest: &lt;b&gt;&quot;Forget everything about linguistics. We are approximately 4000 years before present.&quot;&lt;/b&gt; Are you implying that linguistic processes did not operate 4000 years ago? This assertion is just as ridiculous as a claim that the laws of physics did not work at that time. Or, am I supposed to read it as follows? - &quot;&lt;b&gt;We are approximately 4000 years before present, so we do not know how tha laws of nature, as well as language, operate.&lt;/b&gt;&quot; I hope I am not.
10. Let me suggest something, and I do think it is a fair point: if you want to criticise linguistics and the people who do it, you can do so, of course. However, is it not a good idea to learn first what they have to say, to try to understand them and view the issues from their perspective for a moment? If you want us to change our minds, fine, but maybe you should know something about the things we do first. I am very sorry, but so far you have shown little understanding of the problems one has to face in decipherment and language analysis.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dr. Saul Levin - both a linguist and a cryptologist - has some absolutely fantastic commentary on how to best go about creating and confirming a sound decipherment in his book &quot;The Linear B Controversy Re-examined&quot;.  I&#039;ve included some of his guidelines here:

http://minoan.deaditerranean.com/2011/09/02/cryptolinguistics/

Bennett, Caratelli, Chadwick, Kober, Palmer -many of the early heavy hitters of Mycenology - were trained linguists and relied heavily on linguistics in approaching a decipherment methodically.  Kober&#039;s approach, for instance, relied on case declensions, and was instrumental in Ventris&#039; decipherment work.

Ventris was a gifted linguist - capable of learning a new language within weeks - though he pursued architecture rather than linguistics formally.  His innate linguistic talent was key to his decipherment.  His work - as can be seen in the Work Notes published posthumously - was methodical and linguistic in nature.  He was doing in his head what a lot of us lesser minds have to do on paper with multiple references.   While his evolution of charts sometimes has a voodoo-like quality, deeper research reveals the methodology.  Alternations, symbol frequencies and sign group placement, and phoneme boundaries largely guided his work throughout.

Let&#039;s definitely not throw out linguistics in the decipherment of a language.  It&#039;s front and center.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please refrain from personal attacks.

Kyrillyev is asking some sensible questions about your hypothesis, which is a radical departure from the accepted decipherment of Linear B as Mycenaean Greek.  

Any radical departure will need a bulletproof defense, which means patiently answering detailed and academic questions about any hypothesis.  The community of Mycenologists who have the expertise and power to confirm any Linear B hypotheses will likely respond with far harsher ridicule or ignore something this radical outright.  It&#039;s excellent practice to answer such questions carefully and methodically, with supporting research from other experts.  

There&#039;s ~60 years worth of research out there, and Dygo Tosa at the University of Texas at Austin has put together a brilliant searchable index of research so that you can find relevant articles.  You can search for articles about PY Cn 1287 or ka-na-pe-u, etc.  It&#039;s a wonderful research tool, have a look:

Linguistics has nothing to do with decipherment. Imagine e.g. the development of Mendelejev chemical table. Was his method chemical? No. The material he was using and the outcomes were of chemical nature, but not the method used to decipher the succession of elements. The method he used was observation of chemical properties of the elements. Obsevation of properties! The same in case of Kober and Ventris works. They had linguistic material and linguistic results. But the method used was not linguistic. It was of a very much nature like that of Mendelejev. They observered the proporties of linear sings. That is, they were observing where a certain sign appears, at the beginning of a line, at the end or in the middle. Which signs appear together, which not. Which signs do appear in the middle of „words“ – the conclusion was they are consonants. And so on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I read your comment from 19 July 2012 at 10:32 and I must say you are a hopeless case. After Evans and others found tablets in Greece none linguist contributed to the decipherment of these tablets. Only the amatuers Michael Ventris and Antonín Horák (and his fellows Petr Kovář and Miloš Drastich and others) contributed substantially. Ventris was an architect with english-polish filiation, Horák was a cameramen, Kovář is a civil engineer, Drastich is a journalist with a technical background (university?) etc. And not to forget the Slovenes Matej Bor (linguist and an exception) and Jože Šavle.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2nd line: TERE DO KANAPEU
TERE comes from Serbocroatian &quot;terati&quot; (to run) meaning &quot;I am running&quot; or &quot;he is running&quot;. KANAPEU is the 3. case as DO means &quot;toward&quot; and DO associates always with 3rd case. KANAPĚJ was very probably a man whose profession was to process everything got from hemp (cannabis sativa L.). And he was selling these products, as well. Similar meaning had probably the harbour Canopos with the neolitic name KONOPIŠČĚ. In Czech &quot;konopiště&quot; still means a field where hemp is being grown. 
AKERO means field. The reasoning behind aorist AŘEJO-h is that a person had to finish ploughing the field before I-he-she-it could run to a &quot;konopist&quot;, i.e. DO KANAPĚU. And again. Forget everything about linguistics. We are approximately 4000 years before present.]]></description>
