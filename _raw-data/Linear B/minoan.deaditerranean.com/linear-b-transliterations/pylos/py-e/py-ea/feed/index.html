		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s definitely PY Ea 59.

There are various errors and corrections as the editions of the transliterations evolve.  As Duhoux 2011 points out &quot;Use the best and/or latest edition &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt;&quot; - this is an entire section in how to methodically interpret Linear B.  It&#039;s a great article.

		<description><![CDATA[The text is &lt;i&gt;The Pylos Tablets: Texts of the the Inscriptions found 1939-1954&lt;/i&gt;, which was edited by Bennett in 1955.  Leonard Palmer&#039;s system of classification in his &lt;i&gt;Interpretation of Mycenaean Greek Texts&lt;/i&gt; (1969 reprint) doesn&#039;t include the E series, so I don&#039;t know the classifications for Ea and Eq.  Yet, Palmer correctly references this tablet as Eq 59.  It&#039;s possible that this tablet has since been reclassified, but I suspect a typographical error that has been compounded by repetition, so that, as late as 2011, Duhoux and Davies, in Vol 2  of &lt;/i&gt;A Companion to Linear B&lt;/i&gt;, list this tablet as Ea 59 rather than Eq 59.  In some fonts, it&#039;s difficult to distinguish the &quot;a&quot; from the &quot;q&quot; because the stem for the &quot;q&quot; is just slightly longer than that for the &quot;a&quot;.  In the 1955 work, I had to look twice to ensure that I was reading &quot;q&quot; rather than &quot;a&quot;.  Consequently, I was alert to the difference in your classification.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gretchen,

Which edition of the &lt;em&gt;Pylos Tablets&lt;/em&gt; are you using?  I have it as PY Ea 59 from Bennett and Olivier&#039;s work in 1973.

Thanks,
-kim.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PY Ea 59 should be Eq 59.  It&#039;s easy to misread the &quot;q&quot; as &quot;a&quot; in the &lt;i&gt;Pylos Tablets&lt;/i&gt;. You&#039;re welcome to delete this comment after correction.]]></description>
