		<description><![CDATA[Since LinB is ancient Greek, υ (ūpsilon) would be pronounced /ū/ and ευ would be pronounced /eu/ (as in &lt;i&gt;euphemism&lt;/i&gt;).  One distinction between ancient and modern Greek is the pronunciation of υ, which, in modern Greek,  is pronounced /f/ or /v/, depending upon the consonants that follow it.  Consequently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Ancient_Greek_Romanization_and_Pronunciation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ancient-Greek transliteration&lt;/a&gt; would be more helpful than modern-Greek transliteration for LinB translation.

Yes, it’s interesting that all but &lt;i&gt;u-me-ta-qe&lt;/i&gt; is preceded by the characteristic Greek /eu/ diphthong.  It appears that the use of this diphthong to make the /u/ long marks these as LinB words.  Conversely,  this initial diphthong is absent in LinA.   Instead, LinA words typically begin with /a/, /i/, and /u/.  Initial /o/ is a rarity, with four occurrences, and initial /e/ is non-existent.  I suspect that &lt;i&gt;u-me-ta-qe&lt;/i&gt; is a borrowed LinA word, which does not yet appear in the LinA texts.  I’ve tried numerous permutations without success. 

However, when I entered &lt;i&gt;u-me-ta-qe&lt;/i&gt; in the Japanese dictionary, I retrieved  &lt;i&gt;Umetaka&lt;/i&gt; (surname) and &lt;i&gt;Amataki&lt;/i&gt; (place name).  The frequency with which LinA words return given names, place names, and surnames in the Japanese dictionary appears to be somewhere between 30 and 50 percent.  I&#039;m still tabulating this frequency.  It is likely that the surname indicates a Greek toponym that may be based upon a related definition.  The strongest lead that I have, thus far, is AMETAKI in a Greek New-Testament concordance.  However, I’m not familiar with the transcription so was unable to determine the entry’s significance.  This is another task to add to the to-do list.

Now for some Greek goodies.

I didn’t have any success with the ευμε sequence but had greater success with the ευμη sequence.  I’ve got a match with Εὐμήδης (Eumedes).  Look beyond his name to his occupation as &lt;i&gt;herald&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;messenger&lt;/i&gt;.  Now, check ἑρμῆ (&lt;i&gt;Hermes&lt;/i&gt;, or Roman &lt;i&gt;Mercury&lt;/i&gt;), who was the winged messenger.  In Hermes, you will find e-u-me-ne (Ἑρμῆν) (the &lt;a&gt;
accusative case&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;e-u-mo&lt;/i&gt; (ἑρμοῦ ) (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genitive_case&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;genitive case&lt;/a&gt;).  The οῦ ending that indicates the genitive case is cognate with the word &lt;i&gt;of.  My &lt;i&gt;Lidell and Scott’s Greek/English Lexicon&lt;/i&gt; (1992) shows ερμο-γλυφευς, who is &lt;i&gt;a carver of Hermae&lt;/i&gt;, so there is your Greek root, &lt;i&gt;e-u-mo&lt;/i&gt; (ερμο).  There are numerous words that carry the root for ερμηνηεια, which means &lt;i&gt;interpretation&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;explanation&lt;/i&gt;.   Depending upon the context, the writer could be referring either to Hermes or to an explanation.  

Now, we’ve got a clear reference for checking words that begin with &lt;i&gt;e-u&lt;/i&gt;.  In borrowing the LinA phonetic system, the Mycenaeans may well have compromised the /er/ phoneme with /eu/.  Since &lt;i&gt;Eumedes&lt;/i&gt; is a later word, Greek speakers may have retained the /er/ pronunciation but continued to transcribe these words as /eu/.  Further analysis of similar LinB words may provide valuable clues.

As for &lt;i&gt;e-u-meta&lt;i&gt;, I’ll leave that for another day or for another scholar.

		<description><![CDATA[I was curious to see whether /u/ in Linear B is ever followed by a nasal /m/.  My database has all of the KN inscriptions, and I&#039;m still working on filling out the inscriptions from the other sites so this query isn&#039;t exhaustive yet, but it does provide something interesting.

When I read your comment, it immediately struck me that I couldn&#039;t think of any /u/ + nasal /m/ combinations in Linear B, so I ran a query:

 KN Da 1390+ &#124; {E-U-MO}
 KN Dv 1388  &#124; {E-U-ME-TA}
 PY Ea 259 &#124; {U-ME-TA-QE}
 PY Ea 757   &#124; {e-u-me-ne}
 PY Ea 773   &#124; {e-u-me-de}
 PY Ea 812   &#124; {e-u-me-de}
 PY Ea 820   &#124; {e-u-me-de}
 PY Ea 822   &#124; {e-u-me-ne}

Thanks to Dygo Tosa for pointing it out, this trend is also observed in Aura Jorro&#039;s dictionary entry for u-me-ta-qe.

I grabbed the copy of Bennett &amp; Olivier&#039;s transliterations that I have on loan, and double-checked the exact positioning of u-me-ta-qe (Chadwick &amp; Ventris 1973*) on this tablet, and this particular tangent could keep me busy for a week:  u-me-ta-qe-(a)-po (Bennett &amp; Olivier 1973) is on the .a line above .b - it is above e-ke, and the U is aligned with the KE.  So my next task is going to be looking to see if the .a / .b or &lt;sup&gt;&#039;annot&#039;&lt;/sup&gt; alignments of the scribes have evidence of sharing a beginning symbol elsewhere.

I wonder if the consistent e-u-m* pattern without other /u/ + /m/ combinations is a similar trend in Ancient Greek or Modern Greek, and Linear B is just reflecting that.

It usually takes me awhile to ponder and study these things and really appreciate the full implications, so I may wander back in a few days with a few more thoughts on this.

A quick appendix for those who don&#039;t speak Greek:
ευ is a Greek prefix which means &quot;good&quot; or &quot;well&quot;.

* Chadwick &amp; Ventris&#039; transliteration parsed the top line differently as U-ME-TA-QE [ ]-PO.  Odds greatly favor ending with QE and beginning with A in Linear B, so I&#039;d be curious to see how much of the A is visible and how much spacing there is.  But that&#039;s neither here nor there :)]]></description>
